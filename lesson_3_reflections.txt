git remote -> view current remotes
git remote add [name] [https url]-> add repository on github as a remote of 	[name] 	(default origin if only have one remote)
git remote -v -> v is verbose
git push remote_name branch_name -> push takes 2 arguments: remote name and 
	branch to push
git pull remote_name branch_name -> pull from remote repository to local
	repository, updating local computer files
git clone clone_url -> clones the github repository to local computer
git branch -a -> more information on branches
git fetch remote_name -> updates local repository with remote repository by 	adding to origin/master branch, but does not merge with the local 	master branch yet

PUSHING:  Github will not update files not changed, to be more efficient.  Pushing only pushes the branch and its commits.

FORKING:  Cloning a repository onto your own account on github, so they are connected and gives original owner credit as well.  We clone github repositories onto local computers, but fork feature is on github servers.
Origin remote will point to the forked repository, can set up "upstream" remote to point to the original repository.

CLONING: Use when creating new repositories.  Pull is for updating local repository.  Automatically sets github repository to remote.

CONFLICTS:  Github will automatically merge
	git pull origin master = git fetch origin
				 git merge master origin/master
	Sometimes, if you make a change on another branch, then make a pull 
	request, it won't merge with the original repository master branch 
	because someone else updated it.  So need to create a remote to the
	original repository, update on local computer the upstream remote 
	(git pull upstream master), merge upstream/master with branch_name,
	then push the branch_name branch to the fork, which will update
	the pull request with updated upstream/master branch, so github can
	merge automatically your branch to the original master branch.  Make
	sure when creating remote upstream, use the link of the original repo

PULL REQUEST: A merge request, ask author to merge a branch with the master or something.  Say if there is a typo, make another commit to fix the typo, then push the branch will automatically update the pull request.
